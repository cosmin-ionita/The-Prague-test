# The-Prague-test
This is a Windows Forms application that emulates the Prague Test, which is a distributed attention exercise.

Basically, the screen is split vertically by two fields: the left one, with a matrix of squares composed of two numbers: a big one and a small one, and the right field,
composed of a set of rectangles that contains a number and a text-field, where you have to complete the corresponding number, as you see in the picture.

The key is to complete as much correct numbers as you can (based on their correspondence), in 4 minutes. Your distributed attention is measured based on that metric.
If you complete all 100 fields in less than 4 minutes, you can press the "Check" button located in the bottom-right, in order to evaluate your completion (I've put that
button in order to avoid the situation in which you finish all the fields in 2 minutes, and you have to wait 2 more minutes until the evaluation starts). 

However, nobody finished all the fields in 4 minutes.
